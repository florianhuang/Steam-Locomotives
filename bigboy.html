        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">The Union Pacific's Big Boy is the world's largest and most powerful 
        steam locomotive. Made by the American Locomotive Company, the Big Boy is an articulated locomotive,
        meaning it is seperated into more than one engine unit to allow it to turn without derailing.
        Out of 25 built to haul freight, only 8 exist today.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">UP's Challenger locomotives were used on their mainline on the Wasatch Range.
        However, the sheer climb required two locomotives to pull, which slowed their schedule. A design team
        with Otto Jabelmann at the head worked with ALCO to design an improved Challenger. Big Boys were 
            designed to ride smoothly at 130km/h. Rumoured to be called
        the "Wasatch", a worker wrote "Big Boy" on the front of the locomotive, birthing the name Big Boy.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">The Big Boy is the biggest steam locomotive to exist, the total weight
        of the engine and tender summing up to almost 50000 kilograms, outweighing a Boeing 747. These
        massive engines were on the railroad just in time as America prepared for World War II.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">The price of coal and labour had risen after the war and 
        the more efficient diesel-electric power was becoming popular. Big Boys were one of the last
        steam locomotives in operation at UP. The last Big Boy haul ended early in 1959.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">The most recognized Big Boy is No. 4014. While
        in service, it ran over 1.6 million kilometers and retired in 1961. Not long after, UP
        donated 4014 to the Railway &amp; Locomotive Historical Society, Pomona, US, resulting in it 
        joining the other 8 preserved Big Boys. It was announced in 2013 that R&amp;LHS had agreed
        to return 4014. The locomotive was given an overhaul and conversion to fuel oil. In 2019,
        4014 successfully ran on its own fuel after six decades. Today, Big Bog 4014 still runs today
        on excursions and tours as the biggest and strongest steam locomotive to ever live.</p>
