    <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">The first commercial steam engine created in 1698 by the English inventor Thomas Savery.<br>
        Savery's engine could only see use as small engines, as large ones had the potential to <br>explode.
        His steam engine saw use in mines an supplying water wheels to
        power textile <br>
        machines.</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">Around 1712, the first engine successful in producing continuous power was invented by<br> 
        English inventor Thomas Newcomen. This marked the beginning of piston steam engines. <br>
        From 1763 to 1775, Scottish inventor James Watt improved Newcomen's engine. His <br>early engine used air pressure from pistons instead of steam pressure. Watt's engine<br>
        used half the amount of coal as Newcomen's.
        </p>
    <p>Steam engines were continuously developed throughout the 18th century. Several early<br>
        models of steam locomotives were invented in the 1780s. British inventor Richard <br>
        Trevithick created the first working railway steam locomotive, it's first journey transpiring <br>
        on February 21st, 1804.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Gambetta Light; text-align: center; font-size: .8vw; font-weight: 800; margin-bottom: 50px">FIRST RAILWAY SERVICE OPENS IN FRANCE</p>
        
            <p style="padding-bottom: 15px"> The Saint-Étienne–Lyon railway began construction in 1826 by
        Marc and Camille Seguin. The inhabitants of the land the railway ran on were fiercely against it. They argued that
        the railway would destroy trade.</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 120px">At first, the trains were pulled by horses, one horse hauling up to six empty cars. The trains carried produce, passengers, and other supplies including coal.
        with the use of a steam locomotive, the train could haul up to twenty-eight empty cars, or seven full ones. The line was only opened in certain sections for some time, until fully opening in 1833.
