<p style="padding-bottom: 15px">In 1923, the Great Northern Railway filed an order for ten Gresley Class A1 locomotives
        to be built at Doncaster Works, Doncaster, England. A1 Locomotives were built to haul mainline freight and passenger trains.
        Gresley A1s became a widespread design as GNR absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway. LNER's Flying Scotsman was given the number 4472 
        and is regarded as the most famous Steam Locomotive of all time.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">Named Flying Scotsman after LNER's Flying Scotsman express,
        it became a representing locomotive, appearing in exhibitions and promotions. In 1928, 4472 was selected for the Flying Scotsman nonstop express service,
        along with 4 other locomotives. The tender was upgraded to hold an extra British ton of coal and a corridor connection,
        allowing enginners and firemen to switch out while the train was in motion. Water troughs
        also allowed the train to replenish water while moving. 4472's duties reduced after Gresley's A4s were introduced in 1935,
        but still ran on the mainline and passenger service. Gradually, 4472 and other A1s were converted into
        A3s with more efficient boilers, valves, and cylinders.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">In 1934, Flying Scotsman 4472 reached 100 mph or 161 km/h. The Great 
        Western Railway's 3440 City of Truro reportedly reached the speed years earlier,
            but it had not been verified.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">4472 Flying Scotsman retired in 1963 and was bought by Alan Pegler,
        who called for a complete overhaul. The locomotive was shipped to the US to tour and promote
        
        British goods, but was not financially successful. Pegler ended up in bankruptcy and and left 4472 in the US.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">Eventually, 4472 was returned to Britain, paid by Willain McAlpine. The locomotive went 
        through several overhauls and repairs and frequently went on tours. Flying Scotsman was the first preserved steam train the 
        pull the royal train. Under McAlpine's ownership, 4472 was brought to Australia and achieved a world record of the longest 
        non-stop run by a steam locomotive, totaling 679 kilometres.</p>
  
            <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">After running into financial issues, McAlpine sold 4472 to Tony Marchington, who
        paid for an overhaul with an LNER Apple Green livery and upgrades. Scotsman had also pulled Orient Express trains in the
        early 2000s.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">4472 was being auctioned in 2004. The National Railway Museum in York, England secured the 
        winning bid in fear of 4472 falling into foreign hands. Restoration took place from 2006 to 2016, and Flying Scotsman turned 
        100 in 2023.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px">Although worn with age, the beloved Flying Scotsman still lives as a record holding, 
        magnificent locomotive, featured in tours, exhibitions, and media.</p>
